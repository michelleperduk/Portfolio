    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been conversation about the use of the standardized testing, such as the SAT, across the US and if its use is fair all, or whether there are particular groups for which it is unfair. SAT scores are important to students and schools alike - the scores often play an intergral role in student admission to colleges, while the scores are also used as an indicator overall school district performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, SAT scores will be compared with different demographic information to identify any groups for which the SAT test format may offer unfair advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, data from the City of New York will be cleaned analysed to review SAT performance across groups and demographics. The datasets being used include SAT scores, demographics for each high school, and survey responses from teachers, parents and students from schools in NYC."

    "## Introducing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "All data used in this project is available through the City of New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sets that we will be cleaning, combining and analysing are:\n",
    "- SAT scores by school across New York City\n",
    "- Attendance information for each school\n",
    "- Class size\n",
    "- Advanced Placement (AP) results for each school\n",
    "- Graduation outcomes - percentage of students who graduated and other outcomes\n",
    "- Demographics information for each school\n",
    "- Surey information of teachers, parents and students at each school\n",
    "\n",
    "Background information and understanding on the data and what we are analyzing is imperative. For example:\n",
    "- The SAT test is taken by high school students, so we will need to focus on high schools\n",
    "- Understanding New York boroughs and school districts\n",
    "- Each school in NYC has its own unique number called a 'DBN' (District Borough Number)\n",
    "\n",
    "All the data sets include important and necessary information for our analysis, and so will need to be combined."
