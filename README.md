# Portfolio

Hi there!

After 6+ years of experience of planning and financial roles, my passion and strengths have grown in data analysis and statistical forecasting.
I am self-studying python and machine learning using Dataquest. I get so excited about the opportunities available through data analytics to analyze, understand and predict the world around us!
I am looking for opportunities to further develop and utilize these skills to manage and analyze data, solve problems and improve predictive accuracy for better decision-making. 
I will be uploading guided projects that I complete as a part of my Dataquest "Path to Data Scientist" journey, as well as any other side projects I complete.
